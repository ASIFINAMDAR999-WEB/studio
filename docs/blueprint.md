## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep purple (#673AB7), inspired by the regal associations of 'crowns' and 'platinum' in the top-up plans. 
- Background color: Light gray (#EEEEEE), a desaturated version of the primary purple to provide a neutral backdrop that highlights the plan details. 
- Accent color: Blue-violet (#3F51B5), an analogous hue to the primary purple, offering a contrasting shade for interactive elements and calls to action.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif), suitable for all text, for a clean and modern readability.
- Use simple, outline-style icons to represent plan features and benefits.
- Employ a card-based layout to display each top-up plan clearly, with a clear hierarchy for pricing and features.
